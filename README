INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

The tests will create and use a mock server, unless port 7356 is use,
in which case it will assume a real Gqrx instance is running, and test
against that.  The default location for a server can overriden by
passing the environment variables GQRX_REMOTE_TEST_HOST and
GQRX_REMOTE_TEST_PORT to the tests.
